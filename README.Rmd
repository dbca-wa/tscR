The goal of tscr is to provide access to TSC data, and to provide working 
examples of analysis and visualisation of TSC data to answer QA, ecological, and
management questions.

## Installation

You can install tscr from [GitHub](https://github.com/dbca-wa/tscr/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("dbca-wa/tscr")

Read `vignette("setup", package = "tscr")` to learn how to configure tscr to use 
TSC's API.

## Working examples
Here we'll list vignettes demonstrating working examples of answering questions
with TSC data.
